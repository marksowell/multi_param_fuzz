# Multi Param Fuzzer

A lightweight Python tool for sending grouped HTTP parameter fuzzing requests.

This script allows you to:
- Send multiple query parameters per request
- Control how many parameters are sent at once
- Send all parameters in a single request
- Replicate scanner-style batch probing behavior
- Test for SSTI, reflection, hidden parameters, or behavioral differences

It is useful when reproducing traffic patterns generated by tools like Arjun, Burp Param Miner, or custom batch fuzzers.

## Why This Exists

Most fuzzing tools (like ffuf) send one parameter per request.

However, some scanners batch dozens of parameters into a single request. This tool makes it easy to reproduce that behavior and experiment with grouped parameter testing.

## Features

- Interactive CLI prompts
- Configurable batch size
- Option to send all parameters at once
- URL encoding handled automatically
- Simple and lightweight (no frameworks)
